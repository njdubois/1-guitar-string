Guitar Strings 101!

This is a React app written mainly for string instrument musicians, but it could be used for any western instrument.

This app allows the user to add/remove strings from the top or the bottom of the guitar neck.  Once a string has been added, the user can change the strings tuning, and then clicking on an individual note will toggle whether that note is in the current "scale."
