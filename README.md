Guitar Strings 101!

This is a React app written mainly for string instrument musicians, but it could be used for any western instrument.

This app allows the user to add/remove strings from the top or the bottom of the guitar neck.  Once a string has been added, the user can change the strings tuning, and then clicking on an individual note will toggle whether that note is in the current "scale."

To start the app you must have npm installed globally, then run "npm start" in the root directory.
